#Storyboard Flashlight

This is an iPhone flashlight app made without any programming in 10 minutes to show that flashlight apps are not worth 0.99$. They are not even worth it when they are free since it's so easy to make them!

BTW it's my fist iPhone app! :)
OK, it's not an app, but I need time to start a real one...
